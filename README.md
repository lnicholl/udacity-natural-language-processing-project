In this project I built a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing on articles or blogs found on other websites.

I practiced:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
